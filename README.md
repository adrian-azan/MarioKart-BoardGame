# MarioKart-BoardGame
Capture the character style board game for mario kart

Before starting a race in mario kart, each player selects a 'tile' that they wish to capture. The player who wins recieves that tile and a point. A player can capture a bonus point by winning a tile that would completely surrond another tile from past races (won by either player)

Unfortunately lost the source code for this application. Able to clear board by clearing text file. Able to save by quitting when selecting a winner. Can only select Adrian or Mitch
